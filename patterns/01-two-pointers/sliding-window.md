# Sliding window Pattern

**Description**
This pattern involves a “window” that slides across the array or string. The window can be of a fixed or variable length, 
helping you maintain a subset of elements as you move along, such as a cumulative sum or count.

**Common Uses**
It’s useful in problems requiring you to find subarrays or substrings with certain properties, such as a target sum or unique elements within a range. 
Sliding window is ideal for keeping track of contiguous intervals.

**Example**
Finding the longest substring without repeating characters, or the maximum sum of k consecutive elements.

**When use it**
Focuses on maintaining a subset of contiguous elements within the data.
